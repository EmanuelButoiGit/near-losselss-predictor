# near-losselss-predictor

For this predictor, you need 256x256 grayscale images. 
I prepared a particular folder with Lenna and Peppers :).
Before you load the picture, choose your predictor and K value and save mode.
And the rest it's pretty obvious. Good luck and happy coding!


!BUGS and things to do if you want to fork and continue the project:
1. Histogram only displays positive values
2. Implement arithmetic save mode
3. Check error if it's good
4. Add a different type of fixed save (I would suggest the 9 bits one) -> really easy to implement; add/subtract 255 for the sign
